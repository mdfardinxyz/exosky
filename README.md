## Exosky | 2024 NASA Space App Challenge 

### Task
What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions? The list of 5500+ exoplanets at the NASA Exoplanet Archive can be combined with the latest star catalogs to translate the location and brightness of millions or even billions of stars to another perspective. From that perspective, anyone could use their imagination to draw constellations, much like our ancestors did on Earth thousands of years ago. 

Challenge is to develop an app or interface for students that allows them to choose an exoplanet and then either display an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on a computer or virtual reality display, where they can draw and name constellations. 

### About the Team -- IUB Astra
We are a team of passionate students from Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), with a shared interest in astrophysics and computer science. Our diverse skill set allows us to bridge the gap between these two fields, using innovative technologies to explore the mysteries of the universe. By combining our knowledge of space and computational expertise, we aim to create solutions that contribute to the future of space exploration and scientific discovery. United by our curiosity for the cosmos, we are excited to tackle challenges that push the boundaries of both science and technology.

My Contribution: Constructing the mathematical framework for the app.
